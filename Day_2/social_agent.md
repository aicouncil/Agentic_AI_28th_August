This file contains notes from a meeting on "Agentic AI" held on August 29, 2025. The notes summarize a demonstration by AI Council on agent setup, highlighting the consistency of GPT over Gemini.

Here are the key discussion points from the meeting:

  * **Agent Development and Testing:** AI Council demonstrated the basic setup of an agent, describing it as a "hello world" program. They noted that GPT generally provides more consistent results compared to Gemini and asked Parth Prajapati to test Gemini's functionality.
  * **Exploring Chat Models and Open-Source Options:** The discussion covered various chat models, including Groq Chat and open-source models like Llama and Deepseek, explaining that open-source models are often free alternatives to paid services like GPT. A clarification was made between "Groq" (an LLM model) and "Grok" (a repository for multiple open-source models).
  * **Accessing Open-Source Models via API:** AI Council explained that while open-source models often require local installation, repositories like Groq provide APIs for access. They demonstrated successful access to an open-source model using an API key, noting its effectiveness for story generation.
  * **Strategic Agent Design with Multiple Workers:** A proposal was made to create an agent to function as a social media strategist, outlining the need for specific workers such as a blog writer, video script creator, video title generator, and social media post creator. The importance of well-crafted prompts for these workers was emphasized, suggesting the use of another agent to generate them.
  * **Leveraging Pre-Built Agents from the Marketplace:** AI Council demonstrated using the marketplace to find pre-built agents, specifically a "prompt engineering team" agent designed to write prompts for other agents. This agent includes a "prompt creator" and "prompt reviewer" to ensure high-quality prompts.
  * **Integrating Generated Prompts and Model Tuning:** The demonstration showed how to integrate prompts generated by the "prompt engineering team" agent into the social media agent's workers. The importance of tuning models for optimal performance, by adjusting parameters like "temperature" to control randomness, was also highlighted. GPT was observed to produce a more sequential output compared to an open-source model for the social media agent.
  * **Agent Sharing and Future Development:** AI Council explained how to export agents as JSON files for sharing and mentioned that they would share the developed agents with participants. Himsikha Hazarika inquired about direct social media posting, and AI Council noted its possibility through "tools" and APIs, while cautioning about security implications of exposing credentials.
  * **Importance of Hands-On Agent Creation:** Participants were encouraged to create their own basic agents to understand the process of using pre-built agents from the marketplace and the significance of agent-generated prompts. The next session's topic, "function calling" and "tools" (enabling agents to interact with external services), was briefly introduced, with a strong recommendation for participants to create at least one basic agent beforehand.
  * **Clarifying Agent Structure and Supervisor Role:** For Prashant Vavhal, who had difficulty seeing the screen, AI Council re-explained the basic agent structure, emphasizing the "supervisor" as the central orchestrator and "workers" as independent agents performing specific tasks. For the social media strategist agent, four workers were established under a supervisor to manage different aspects of social media content creation.

The suggested next step is for Prashant Vavhal to review the video part, and AI Council will re-explain the whole thing in the next session.
